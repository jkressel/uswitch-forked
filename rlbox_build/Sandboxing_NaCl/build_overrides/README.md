# Build overrides in GN

This directory is used to customize settings for repos that are DEPS'ed
in and shared with Chromium.

build.gni was copied verbatim from Chromium's copy of //build_overrides
and should be kept in sync with Chromium's version.

gtest.gni contains modification which are specific to Native Client.
